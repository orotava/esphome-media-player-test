## Features

Overview of what the media controller does. Many features are user-configurable from the device's web settings page — no YAML or reflashing needed. You can open it by visiting the device IP address directly in your browser, or from the device in Home Assistant under **Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** by clicking **Visit**. See [Web Settings](/features/webserver) for how to open it and [Settings](/features/settings) for the full reference.

### Album art display

Full-screen album art is loaded from your Home Assistant instance. When a new track starts, the current artwork dims to 40% while the new image downloads, then fades back to full brightness. If artwork doesn't appear, see [Troubleshooting](/advanced/troubleshooting#the-artwork-isnt-loading).

### Now playing info

The screen shows song title, artist, elapsed and remaining time, and a progress bar. The bar updates every second with smooth interpolation between position updates from Home Assistant. Tap the time label to toggle between elapsed/remaining and elapsed/total duration display. The default mode is set by the **Track Clock** setting in [Settings](/features/settings).

### Linked media player (optional)

If your speaker has a secondary input — either a **TV source** (soundbars with HDMI) or a **Line-in source** (speakers/amps with a 3.5mm/RCA input) — the controller can show now-playing info from the media player connected to that input (e.g. Apple TV, Chromecast). This feature is entirely optional and the controller works without it.

- **Automatic switching** — when the primary media player's source becomes "TV" or "Line-in", the UI shows title, artist, artwork, and progress from the linked media player. When the source changes back, the UI reverts to the primary player.
- **Idle state** — when the linked player is idle, off, or on standby, the screen displays the source name ("TV" or "Line-in") on a black background with playback controls hidden. Controls reappear when the linked player starts playing again.
- **Routed controls** — play/pause, next, and previous are automatically sent to whichever player is active (music or linked).

To enable this, set the optional **Linked Media Player** field to the entity ID of the media player connected to your input (e.g. `media_player.apple_tv`). Leave it empty to disable.

### Speaker grouping

Group and ungroup multi-room speakers directly from the touchscreen. A speaker icon appears on the main screen — tap it to open a panel listing all your speakers with toggle switches to group or ungroup them. 

This feature works with any speaker platform that supports grouping in Home Assistant. Requires a one-time setup of a template helper in Home Assistant — see [Speaker Grouping](/features/speaker-grouping) for instructions.

### Touch controls

- **Play / Pause** — button in the bottom-right toggles playback.
- **Next / Previous** — swipe left or right to change tracks.
- **Volume** — swipe down to open the settings panel with an arc dial. Drag the knob or use + / − for 1% steps. Swipe up to close.
- **Hide / Show UI** — tap the screen during playback to hide or show the overlay (4" only).

### Firmware updates

The device checks for new firmware automatically and can install updates over-the-air — no USB cable needed. You control the behavior from Home Assistant: enable or disable auto-update, choose a check frequency (hourly, daily, or weekly), and trigger manual installs at any time. See [Firmware Updates](/features/firmware-updates) for details.

### Screen saver

When playback is paused, the device dims the screen after a configurable delay, then either shows a clock or turns the screen off. An optional clock screen saver displays the time in large digits on a black background — it drifts subtly to prevent burn-in. Brightness levels and behavior adjust automatically between day and night. Any touch or new media playback instantly wakes the screen.

See [Screen Saver](/features/screen-saver) for full details and settings.

### Screen tone (ESP32-P4)

Album art can be shifted toward warmer colors for a more comfortable viewing experience. Separate day and night warmth sliders follow the same day/night detection used by the screen saver, so the display can look neutral during the day and warmer at night. See [Settings](/features/settings#screen-tone) to configure.
