# Settings

Most settings are configurable from the device page in Home Assistant (**Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** → your device) — no YAML or reflashing needed.

| Setting | Description |

## Screen Tone <Badge type="info" text="ESP32-P4 only" />

Shifts album art toward warmer colors (reduced blue, slight red boost) for a more comfortable viewing experience — especially at night. Separate day and night sliders follow the same [day/night detection](/features/screen-saver#day-night-awareness) used by screen brightness. The tint updates instantly without reloading the image.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Day: Screen Warmth** | Warmth applied to album art during the day. 0% = no tint, 100% = maximum warmth. Default: 30%. |
| **Night: Screen Warmth** | Warmth applied to album art at night. 0% = no tint, 100% = maximum warmth. Default: 60%. |

## Volume

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Speaker Panel Auto-Close** | Turns automatic closing of the volume/speaker panel on or off. Default: on. |
| **Speaker Panel Auto-Close Timer** | Time without any touch interaction before the speaker panel automatically closes and returns to the now-playing view. Hidden in the browser when auto-close is off. Default: 15 seconds. |
| **Source Input Media Player** | (Optional) Entity ID of a media player connected to the speaker's TV or Line-in input. See [Source Inputs](/features/source-inputs). Leave empty to disable. |
| **Speaker Group Sensor** | (Optional) Entity ID of the template sensor for [Speaker Grouping](/features/speaker-grouping). Leave empty to disable. |

## Playback

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Track Clock** | Browser setting for the now-playing time label. On shows time remaining; off shows the track length. Tap the time label on the device to toggle this at any time. |
| **Media Player Entity** | The `media_player` entity to control. |

## Advanced

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Linked Media Player** | Optional `media_player` entity used when the main speaker switches to a TV or Line-in source. The screen can show now-playing details from this related player instead of the main speaker. |

## Device

The browser Device tab contains clock settings, day/night source, screen brightness, screen tone, supported rotation controls, and firmware update controls.
