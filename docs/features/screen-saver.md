# Screen Saver

When playback is paused and paused dimming is enabled, the device uses a two-stage screen saver to reduce power consumption and prevent burn-in. All settings are configurable from the device page in Home Assistant (**Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** → your device).

## How it works

1. **Dimming** — If **Screen Saver: Dim When Paused** is on, after **Screen Saver: Paused Dimming** elapses (default: 60 s), the screen dims to the **Day/Night: Dim Brightness** level.
2. **Idle action** — After **Screen Saver: Timer** elapses (default: 300 s), the selected day or evening screen saver runs:
   - **Clock** shows a large `HH:MM` clock.
   - **Off** turns the display fully off.

Any touch or new media playback instantly returns the display to full active brightness.

## Clock screen saver

The optional clock screen saver displays the current time in large, thin digits on a black background. Choose **Clock** as the day or evening screen saver to use it.

The clock position drifts subtly each minute across a small region to prevent burn-in. Brightness is controlled independently for day and evening clock screen savers (default: 35%).

## Night Schedule

**Night Schedule** can turn the display fully off outside a daily time window. For example, an **On Time** of 6:00 AM and an **Off Time** of 8:00 PM keeps the screen available during the day and turns it off overnight.

Touching the screen during the off period wakes it temporarily. **When Woken, Idle Time To Screen Off** controls how long it stays awake before returning to scheduled screen-off.

## Day/Night awareness

Brightness levels and screen saver behavior adapt automatically based on whether it is currently "day" or "night":

- **Daytime** — uses **Day: Active Brightness**, **Day: Dim Brightness**, and **Daytime Screen Saver**.
- **Evening** — uses **Night: Active Brightness**, **Night: Dim Brightness**, and **Evening Screen Saver**.

This lets you configure different behavior for day and night — for example, showing the clock during the day but turning the screen off at night. On the ESP32-P4, [Screen Tone](/features/settings#screen-tone) warmth also follows the same day/night detection, so album art can shift warmer at night.

By default, the device reads the `sun.sun` entity in Home Assistant (sun above horizon = day, below horizon = night). You can override this with any `binary_sensor` or `input_boolean` entity by setting the **Day-Night Sensor** field on the device page.

### Custom day/night sensor

To use your own logic for day vs night:

1. Create a `binary_sensor` or `input_boolean` helper in Home Assistant that reflects your preferred day/night state (`on` = day, `off` = night).
2. On the ESPHome device page (**Settings → Devices & Services → ESPHome** → your device), enter the entity ID in the **Day-Night Sensor** field — for example, `binary_sensor.daytime` or `input_boolean.is_daytime`.
3. The device will immediately start using the custom sensor instead of `sun.sun`.

To revert to the default sun-based behavior, clear the **Day-Night Sensor** field.

This is useful when you want day/night to depend on more than just the sun — for example, room lighting levels, party mode, or a time-based schedule.
