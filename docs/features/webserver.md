# Web Settings

The firmware includes a built-in webserver for configuration and setup. After the device is on your Wi-Fi network, open the device IP address in a browser on the same network to configure it without editing YAML or reflashing.

You can also open the same page from Home Assistant by going to **Settings -> Devices & Services -> ESPHome**, selecting the media player device, and clicking **Visit**.

## What it is for

The webserver is the main setup page for current firmware. It lets you choose the Home Assistant media player to control, tune the screen behaviour, and manage firmware updates from your browser.

Common setup tasks include:

- Selecting the main `media_player` entity.
- Setting an optional linked media player for TV or Line-in sources.
- Adjusting brightness, dimming, screen saver, and night schedule behaviour.
- Choosing timezone and day/night detection.
- Checking for firmware updates or changing automatic update behaviour.
- Changing screen rotation on supported ESP32-P4 panels.

See [Settings](/features/settings) for the full list of controls.

## Opening the page

1. Make sure your computer or phone is connected to the same network as the device.
2. Find the device IP address in your router, ESPHome, or Home Assistant.
3. Open `http://DEVICE-IP` in your browser, replacing `DEVICE-IP` with the real address.

If Home Assistant has discovered the ESPHome device, you can use **Visit** from the ESPHome device page instead of typing the IP address manually.

## First-time setup

On a fresh install, open the webserver and set **Media Player** to the Home Assistant entity you want the touchscreen to control, for example `media_player.living_room_speaker`.

When this value is saved, the device may reboot so the firmware can subscribe to the correct Home Assistant entity. This is expected. After it comes back online, the touchscreen should show artwork and controls for the selected media player.

## How the page loads

The device serves the settings page on port `80`. The firmware uses the project's hosted web UI bundle, so the device needs internet access the first time your browser loads the page.

The browser talks directly to the device while you make changes. On the 4" ESP32-S3 display, opening the webserver also shows a **Web settings active** screen on the device while the browser is connected.

## Troubleshooting

If the page does not open:

- Check that the device and browser are on the same network.
- Try the Home Assistant **Visit** button if you are unsure of the IP address.
- Use `http://` rather than `https://`.
- Wait for the device to finish booting after a firmware update or settings save.

If the page opens but settings do not apply, check that Home Assistant can see the device and that the selected entity ID is valid. For wider connection problems, see [Troubleshooting](/advanced/troubleshooting).
