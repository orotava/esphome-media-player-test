# ESPHome Media Player for Home Assistant

Turn an ESP32 touchscreen into a dedicated music controller for your home.

This project gives Home Assistant users a small, always-on display for their speakers. It shows album artwork, track details, playback progress, volume, and useful controls without needing to open the Home Assistant app or pick up a phone.

## What this unlocks

ESPHome Media Player is for people who want their music controls to feel like part of the room.

You can place a touchscreen next to a speaker, on a desk, by the sofa, in the kitchen, or anywhere you want quick control. Once connected to Home Assistant, the display follows the media player you choose and becomes a dedicated control surface for that room.

With it, you can:

- **See what's playing at a glance** with large album art, title, artist, and progress.
- **Control music without opening an app** using touch controls for play, pause, skip, and volume.
- **Give guests and family a simple shared controller** without giving them access to your phone or Home Assistant dashboard.
- **Make speaker setups feel more polished** by adding a purpose-built display to Sonos, Google Cast, Music Assistant, and other Home Assistant media players.
- **Control multi-room speaker groups** from the screen when your speaker platform supports grouping.
- **Use TV or Line-in sources more clearly** by showing the active source and linked playback information where supported.
- **Keep the screen comfortable day and night** with dimming, screen saver, clock, night brightness, and optional warmer screen tone.

The goal is simple: take the media players you already have in Home Assistant and give them a physical touchscreen experience.

## What you can do from the screen

- View full-screen album artwork.
- See song title, artist, elapsed time, remaining time, and progress.
- Play, pause, skip forward, and skip back.
- Adjust volume with a touch-friendly control.
- Open speaker grouping controls on supported platforms.
- Let the screen dim, show a clock, or turn off when nothing is playing.
- Wake the screen with a touch or when playback starts again.

## Easy setup and updates

You do not need to be a developer to use the normal release builds.

The documentation includes a browser-based installer that flashes the firmware to a supported display. After the first install, the device joins your Wi-Fi network, appears in Home Assistant through ESPHome, and can be configured from its own local settings page.

From that settings page you can choose the Home Assistant media player to control, adjust brightness and idle behavior, configure screen saver options, and manage firmware updates. Future updates can install over Wi-Fi, so you usually do not need to reconnect the USB cable after setup.

## Works with Home Assistant

ESPHome Media Player is built for Home Assistant and ESPHome. It controls Home Assistant media player entities, so the exact features available depend on what your speaker, TV, or media integration exposes to Home Assistant.

It has been tested with Google and Sonos speakers, and it is designed to work with any Home Assistant media player that provides the needed controls and media information.
